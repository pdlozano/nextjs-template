# NextJS Template

This is a NextJS Template built to make project prototyping a bit faster than usual. With this template, you can focus more on the underlying logic without worrying much about styling WHILE simultaneously making sure it does not look like crap.

The changes this makes from the usual NextJS build are:

-   Using `tailwindcss` for new builds. You don't have to use this but I feel like it's a good package for developing styles fast.
-   Using a `MainComponent` for handling pages. The "pages" should focus on handling how the components work together rather than how it works and how it looks. They should also handle the data collection and parsing.
